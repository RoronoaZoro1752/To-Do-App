# To Do App

This is a streamlined and efficient To Do application designed to assist users in organizing and managing their daily tasks. Built using the robust combination of **ReactJS**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**, this project exemplifies modern web development practices. Through this endeavor, I gained hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of key React concepts, including **state management**, **component-based architecture**, **props for data flow**, and **hooks for lifecycle and state logic**.

- **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be edited as needed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from their list.
